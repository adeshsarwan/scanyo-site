# Scanyo QR – Landing Page

A super‑light static landing for GitHub Pages.

## How to use
1. Create a new repo (e.g. `scanyo-site`) and upload these files.
2. Replace the Play Store link in `index.html` (search for `YOUR_APP_ID`) with your real app id.
3. Enable **GitHub Pages** in repo settings → Pages → Source: `Deploy from a branch`, Branch: `main` → `/root`.
4. In a minute or two, your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Files
- `index.html` — single page with inline CSS and responsive grid.
- `assets/` — app screenshots.
